### How to use 
1. Make sure the directory to MUSDB instrumental tracks directory and to DAMP audio directory under `../damp_config.py` is correctly set. 
2. Run the following
```
python mashability.py 
```

### General code
Checkout [vocalMashup](https://github.com/kyungyunlee/vocalMashup). I will probably add better mashup code for future work.
